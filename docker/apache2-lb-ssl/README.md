This Dockerfile and related files can be used to build an Apache2 web server image with common modules for rewrite, reverse-proxy and load-balancing installed, along with SSL proxy, redirect and passthrough support.

There are several testcases in the `testcases` directory to try out the various Virtual Host configurations to support these features of Apache2 web server.
